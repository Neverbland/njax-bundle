NJAX
====

NJAX is "Navigation in AJAX".

Allows browsers to navigate your page without doing full page loads,
but rather making AJAX requests and injecting responses into the body
using history.pushState() functionality to manipulate the browser's
addres bar.

Greatly speeds up navigation.

Very similar and in fact greatly based on
[PJAX](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax) with some added functionality:

- Loads CSS and JavaScript files located on loaded page and caches them in memory.
- More configurable.

TBD.
